# Maze Rush

## Description
A website that allows a user to generate mazes of a specified dimension
and solve it. Also, the user may share the maze's seed to another user to
solve the same maze together for competition purposes. Lastly, the process
of solving each maze is timed for the player to reference.

## Note
There are a lot of configuration options for the generated mazes that I dont let
the player change simply to keep the website looking clean and uncluttered. I will
work on this in the future.
